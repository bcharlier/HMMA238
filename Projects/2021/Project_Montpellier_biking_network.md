# Montpellier biking network simulation

## Group affected: 

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos of the flow in the city of Montpellier during a full week.

For that you will have to load the graph of the roads/bike trails in Montpellier using the Python package `osmnx`, and also the open data from https://compteurs.velocite-montpellier.fr/ 

## Video

The video of interest should represent the flow of bicycle on the graph representing the city of Montpellier, during a day.

**Bonus:** provide also a way to produce a video similar to that one below in terms of rendering (use a blurring effect to perform the trail behind the points):
