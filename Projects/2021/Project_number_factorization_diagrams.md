# Number visualization 

The motivation of this project is to create package that reproduces in Python both the animation of
http://www.datapointed.net/visualizations/math/factorization/animated-diagrams/
and the poster provided by:
https://www.jasondavies.com/factorisation-diagrams/

In particular variations on the colors, orientations and alternative visualization will be investigated, as well as time efficiency of the code.

Inspiration from the R code is fine: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2012/11/prime-factorization-visualization-with-r-and-shiny/
