# Fourier transform

Inspired by the video

create a package that can reproduce a similar video.
A particular interest on the parameters (degrees of approximation), speed of the videos would be of interest.
Test and analysis on various images should be investigated.
As a simple case, one would start with the constraint that the input image can be a black and white svg file.
Then, adaptation to color cases and to general image format (like png, jpg, etc. ) could be added.
