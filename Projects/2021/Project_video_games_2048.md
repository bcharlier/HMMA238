## Strategy Comparison and Numba Parralel

We want to know if there are strategies to take the game further. You can for examples compare the following strategies :
- random movement
- right movement
- left movement
- clockwise movement

To do so, we will need to launch many games to test the different cases (Monte-Carlo), so, it will be interesting to parallelize the process.
