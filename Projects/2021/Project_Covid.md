The goal of this project is to analyze the spreading of the covid19 disease in France. A first goal is to produce an animation like
[this](https://informatique-mia.inrae.fr/biosp/sites/informatique-mia.inra.fr.biosp-d7/files//field/image/spatio_temporal_covid.gif). 
Then you can produce various charts to illustrate how the covid19 affect population by age (e.g. a dashboard with various statistical features). 

## Dataset
