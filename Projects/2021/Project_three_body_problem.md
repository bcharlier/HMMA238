# Three Body Problem

## Group affected: group ?? and ??

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos representing the trajectories of the sun, mars and the earth, in three dimensions.

To do so, we need to solve numerically the three body problem, which will lead to use numerical methods for differential equations.

## Numba acceleration

To accelerate the numerical resolution, we might find useful to consider accelerated versions of your work using the numba package.
