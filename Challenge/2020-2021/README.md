This will be a personal work, and includes an aesthetic part and prediction part.


## Due date

## Description

### Prediction part

For this part, you will use the data from [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVtdpXMHB4g9h75a0jw8CsrqSuQmP5eMIB2adpKR5hkRggwMwzFy5kB-AIThodhVHNLxlZYm8fuoWj/pub?gid=2105854808&single=true&output=csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVtdpXMHB4g9h75a0jw8CsrqSuQmP5eMIB2adpKR5hkRggwMwzFy5kB-AIThodhVHNLxlZYm8fuoWj/pub?gid=2105854808&single=true&output=csv) to predict the number of bicycle passing between 00:01 AM and 09:00 AM on Friday, April 2nd:
Upload a single .pdf file in Moodle (section "Validation") with the constraints: size <= 2 pages, font size >= 11) describing your methodology.
Add your (integer) prediction here (see the framacalc given in moodle for that).
You can use information from other sources, but you have to describe how you handle it.
A git link to the code providing the (integer) answer is required in the .pdf and will be investigated to double check the methodology used.

### Visualization part

For this part, you will use the data from [http://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs/resource/75f5e367-99fb-482f-ba5c](http://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs/resource/75f5e367-99fb-482f-ba5c) to visualize the bike traffic in Montpellier. The nature of the visualization could be an animation (gif, mp4) or a widget (e.g., https://github.com/josephsalmon/Random-Widgets and mybinder for hosting the file). You will provide a hyperlink pointing to a **single file** that can be opened on the chromium browser of the university/X2go machines.
