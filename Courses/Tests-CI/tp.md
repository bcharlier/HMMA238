# Unit Tests and integration tests

This lecture what taken from <https://amueller.github.io/COMS4995-s19/slides/aml-02-python-git-testing/#45>

## Tests

Tests are small pieces of code ensuring that a part of a program is working as expected.

### Why tests are useful

This is why we place utter most importance in implementing tests **along** the development step. It will help you to ensure:

- that code works correctly.
- that changes do not break anything.
- that bugs are not reintroduced.
- robustness to user errors.
- code is reachable.

### Types of tests

There are different kinds of tests:

1. Unit tests: they test whether a function does the right thing.
2. Integration tests: they test whether the system/process does the right thing.
3. Non-regression tests: they test whether a bug got removed (and will not be reintroduced).

### How to test?

Many coding languages come with their own test framework.
In python, we will focus on [`pytest`](http://doc.pytest.org).
It is simple though powerful. `pytest` searches for all `test*.py` files and runs all `test*` methods found. It outputs a nice errors report.

1. Install `pytest` with `pip` using the user scheme (`--user` option)
2. Test if the command `pytest` is in your PATH (depending on your configuration you will have to add `~/.local/bin` in PATH)

Get the path to `pytest` binary
```python
>>> import pytest
>>> pytest.__path__
/path/to/pytest
```
then, in a terminal
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/pytest
$ pytest --help
```
----

### Example

Let us assume we have a file `inc.py` containing

```python
def inc1(x):
    return x + 1

def inc2(x):
    return x + 2
```

Thence, the content of `test_inc.py` is

```python
from inc import inc1, inc2

# This test will work
def test_inc1():
    assert inc1(3) == 4

# This test will fail
def test_inc2():
    assert inc2(-1) == 4
```

To run these tests:

```bash
$ pytest test_inc.py
```

1. Correct the `test_inc2` test.
2. Determine the syntax to run any test in a directory.
3. Determine the syntax to run only the test called `test_inc1`.

## Code coverage

`pytest` comes with some useful [plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/plugins.html). In particular, we will use the coverage report plugin.

A **test coverage** is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.

To install the coverage plugin simply run

```bash
$ pip install pytest-cov
```

Assuming the `inc_cov.py` contains:

```python
def inc(x):
    if x < 0:
        return 0
    return x + 1

def dec(x):
     return x - 1
```

and a single test is performed through the file `test_inc_cov.py`

```python
from inc_cov import inc

def test_inc():
     assert inc(3) == 4
```

then

```bash
$ pytest inc_cov --cov

### <font color='red'>Exercise:</font>

1. Install the `pytest`'s coverage plugin.
2. Load the `biketrauma` package you can download at <https://github.com/HMMA238-2020/biketrauma/>
3. Add some unit tests to `biketrauma` in a new sub-directory `./biketrauma/tests/`:
    - Create a first `test_df()` that test if the Côtes-d'or département has 459 accidents. And a second `test_df_log()` testing that the log of the number of accident in the département 92 is close to `7.651120176`.

    - Create a `test_dl()` function that tests the `md5sum` hash of the downloaded file (a.k.a. `bicycle_db.csv`). It should be `ee8c4e0e7989bc6aac7876d7501bbf4d`. You can use this piece of code to compute the md5sum:

```python
import hashlib
def md5(fname):
    hash_md5 = hashlib.md5()
    with open(fname, "rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
            hash_md5.update(chunk)
    return hash_md5.hexdigest()
```

You should achieve a 92% of code coverage:

```bash
----------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.7.6-final-0 -----------
Name                                    Stmts   Miss  Cover

## Continuous integration

In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline on a regular basis. It is often split in 3 steps:

1. automate the tests: run command on each commit (or each Pull Request), typically unit tests and integration tests.
2. automate the build: when dealing with a compiled language, compile the source to generate binaries. I can also build the documentation.
3. automate the deployment: send the binaries to the repository.

A CI pipeline runs commands on some virtual machine automatically.

Reference: <https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-and-testing-code-with-continuous-integration/setting-up-continuous-integration-using-github-actions>

### Benefits of CI

- One can not forget to run tests and immediate feedback is provided: it runs at each commit or Pull Request. A report is sent to the commit author.
- Protects the master branch: commit or PR can be rejected if test do not pass.
- Contributor doesn't need to know details: only project maintainer needs to know how the system works.
- Can enforce style: a linter can run to check PEP8.
- Can check the code on many systems: virtual machines can run Linux, Window or MacOs systems.

### What do you need ?

Many solutions exist to run CI pipelines ([Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Github](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-and-testing-code-with-continuous-integration/about-continuous-integration), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/), [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/devops/pipelines/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)...). They all:

- run test when a [web-hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) is triggered (usually at each push or PR).
- can act as a build-farm (for binaries or documentation) on a "build matrix" (i.e. run on many environments).
- Requires clear declaration of dependencies and set-up virtual machines (that should be maintained).
- Reports success/Failure to the CSV.

### Example

Github has recently developed a high-level solution of CI. Befor digging into the process, please make sure that your test file is working locally. You should have something like:

```python
$ pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform linux -- Python 3.7.6, pytest-5.3.5, py-1.8.1, pluggy-0.13.1

```

#### Add a `.github/workflows` file

Setting up a CI is rather easy. It is sufficient to add a single text file `.github/workflows` in your project. `Github` has developed a graphical user interface to do it:

1. In your github project repository: Go to Actions menu and then select `python package` workflow.
2. Custom the `workflows` file depending on your needs. Beware: getting a correct configuration file is sometime tedious with CI system...
3. You can add a `badge` showing the result of CI to the end-user directly in your Readme.md
